[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/auremoser/pirateplotr/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free "Bitdeli Badge")

This is a visualization of projects and milestones for RNI.

Check out the [Pirate Plotr Render here](http://auremoser.github.io/pirateplotr/).

### about
This simple sortable chart for viewing projects and tracking them on a timeline is primarily for coordination between RNI and the Rockefeller Foundation, including the 100 Resilient Cities team. It is useful for a quick global view of what's going on when and how the milestones/expectations/resourcing need to be managed.

### how to
1. Edit data in the Google Spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/a/ushahidi.com/spreadsheets/d/1C-s16NaQBkzZSHRl1SvFBjnvJ03GQ74yJ2-Bf5MW1u0/edit#gid=0).
2. Spreadsheet will update in the chart on a semi-frequent basis (depends on google, usually you can refresh the [RNI Schedule Plotr](XXXXXXXXX) every 5 minutes and it will show your changes); all changes will be checked and QAuto-integrated for Monday morning calls.
3. View and Sort the chart! [Check the RNI Schedule Plotr Render page.](XXXXXXXX)

### data
Data csv looks like this:

![data.csv](https://raw2.github.com/auremoser/images/master/plotr-sheet.png)

Headers are static, but all values are editable in the data.csv file.

deliverable	| priority	| start_date	| end_date 	| team | type
:---:	| :----: 	| :--------: 	| :------: 	| :----: | :----:
project1 | value1 	| date1 		| date2 	| [V3/CrisisNet/...] | external
project2 | value2 	| date1 		| date2 	| [V3/CrisisNet/...] | core

#### key
* **deliverable** is project name
* **priority** is an arbitrary weight (price point? resources?)[2]
* **dates** are the start and end date of a project
* **team** is the name of the team responsible for the deliverable
* **type** is one of 4 categories for filtering purposes (core, external, ops, milestone)[3]

This is spreadsheet-powered because that's a maintainable format for all contributors; easily editable/updatable.

Yays thanks for reading! Shoot me questions if you have any: aurelia@ushahidi.com.

[1]: Previously, I manually updated the /data/data.csv file and then populated that data in the chart. Now the chart is GDoc powered, to enable easier editing for all pirates in the party. :)

[2]: We can decide what numerical value to prioritize by, I just wanted to log this as a sortable placeholder for future values we might want to track.

[3]: Milestones are vertical plum lines on the chart. You can draw a plum line, as opposed to a bar, by entering a deliverable name, start_date and type of project as "milestone"). Check the csv for examples of this.
