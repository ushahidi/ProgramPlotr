RNI Schedule Plotr
===========

This is a visualization of activities and milestones for the Resilience Network Initiative (RNI). Click here to see the [RNI Schedule Plotr](http://ushahidi.github.io/RNIplotr/).

### About
This simple, sortable chart for viewing projects and tracking them on a timeline is primarily for coordination between RNI and the Rockefeller Foundation, including the 100 Resilient Cities team. It is useful for a quick global view of what's going on when and how the milestones/expectations/resourcing need to be managed.

### Adding/Editing Projects & Milestones
Edit data in the [Google Spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqED8MaMr0uLdGZIUlVRMDBwNEdoM0lyLXVhZVY0a2c&usp=sharing). The spreadsheet will update in the chart on a semi-frequent basis. It depends on Google, usually you can refresh the [RNI Schedule Plotr](http://ushahidi.github.io/RNIplotr/) every 5 minutes and it will show your changes.

### Viewing & Sorting the Chart
View the chart on the [RNI Schedule Plotr](http://ushahidi.github.io/RNIplotr/). Use the “SORT BY” bar at the top of the screen to sort by:
* **Deliverable**: sorts alphabetically by deliverable name.
* **Start Date**: sorts by start dates.
* **End Date**: sorts by end dates.
* **Team**: groups deliverables by team.

You can reverse the order of the sort by clicking the same selection again. For example, clicking "Deliverable" will first sort the deliverables alphabetically. Clicking "Deliverable" again will sort the deliverables in _reverse_ alphabetical order.

### Data
This is spreadsheet-powered because that's a maintainable format for all contributors; easily editable/updatable. Anyone with a link to the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqED8MaMr0uLdGZIUlVRMDBwNEdoM0lyLXVhZVY0a2c&usp=sharing) can make edits.
